The goal here is to build a JavaScript class called FQL that will be a pure JavaScript implementation of SQL.  By working on this exercise, you will get a chance to explore how the inner workings of a database engine might work.

Run these tests with "testem".  IMPORTANT: One thing to realize is that testem will automatically bring 0_movies.js into your environment (and hence load the data).  0_movies.js is a small version of the IMDB database that you've been working with previously.

Work on these exercises and continue switching off each exercise with your pairing partner.
